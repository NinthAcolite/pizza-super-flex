        Should a machine not function upon striking the panel marked "on" this
        is an omen of great ill. The reasons ascribed may be as follows.
        Firstly, the function of inadequate preparation on the part of the
        operator. Secondly, the action of the machine whose spirit may refuse
        the binding of the operator. Thirdly, the malintent of some third party
        upon the operator or machine. The operator must repeat the ritual from
        the beginning re-purifying himself, enscribing the runes, intoning the
        incantations, and striking the panel marked 'on'. An accompanying oath
        may be made. Should this procedure fail, the operator must recourse to
        consulting the instruction manual. - Book of the Astronomican, pg. 18
